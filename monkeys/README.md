	You may have heard of the infinite monkey theorem? The theorem states that
a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount
of time will almost surely type a given text, such as the complete works of
William Shakespeare. Well, suppose we replace a monkey with a Python function.
How long do you think it would take for a Python function to generate just one
sentence of Shakespeare? The sentence we’ll shoot for is: “methinks it is like
a weasel”.
	The way we’ll simulate this is to write a function that generates a string
that is 28 characters long by choosing random letters from the 26 letters in
the alphabet plus the space. We’ll write another function that will score each
generated string by comparing the randomly generated string to the goal.
	A third function will repeatedly call generate and score, then if 100% of
the letters are correct we are done. If the letters are not correct then we
will generate a whole new string.To make it easier to follow your program’s
progress this third function should print out the best string generated so far
and its score every 1000 tries.
